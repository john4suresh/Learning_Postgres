Primary Key

A primary key is a column or a group of columns used to identify a row uniquely in a table.
Technically, a primary key constraint is the combination of a not-null constraint and a UNIQUE constraint.
A table can have one and only primary key.
It is a good practice to add a primary key to every table.

Foreign Key

A foreign key is a column or a group of columns in a table that reference the primary key of another table.
The table that contains the foreign key is called the referencing table or child table. 
And the table referenced by the foreign key is called the referenced table or parent table.
A table can have multiple foreign keys depending on its relationships with other tables.

Example:
CREATE TABLE product(
type_id INTEGER REFERENCES product_type(id),
name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
supplier VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
description TEXT NOT NULL,
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY);
